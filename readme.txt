In Love With Numbers (iLWN)

This repository holds MDPN (Most Delayed Palindromic Number), P196 (196
Palindrome Quest) and ALSN (All Lychrel Seed Numbers) projects and iLWN
website source code.

iLWN is a series of mathematical would-be scientific projects built on a
common source code base. Most of these projects are searching for unusual
numbers. Thus, the MDPN project is all about searching for the most delayed
palindromes. The P196 project is trying to check whether the number 196 (the
very first Lychrel number) as well as some other numbers will ever become a
palindrome as a result of repeated RAA (Reverse-And-Add) operation on it.
The ALSN project is enumerating Lychrel seed numbers.
