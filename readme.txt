In Love With Numbers (iLWN)

This repository holds MDPN (Most Delayed Palindromic Number) and
P196 (196 Palindrome Quest) projects and iLWN website source code.

iLWN is a series of mathematical would-be scientific projects built on a
common source code base. Each of these projects is searching for unusual
numbers. Thus, the MDPN project is all about searching for the most delayed
palindromes. The P196 project is trying to check whether the number 196 (the
very first Lychrel number) as well as some other numbers will ever become a
palindrome as a result of repeated RAA (Reverse-And-Add) operation on it.
Other projects are enumerating Lychrel seed numbers and primes.
